Here are the main program analysis techniques used for vulnerability detection:

## Static Analysis Techniques
- **Code Property Graphs (CPG)** - Multi-layered graph representation (AST + CFG + PDG)
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Analysis** - Structure-based pattern matching
- **Control Flow Analysis** - Execution path and reachability analysis
- **Data Flow Analysis** - Tracking data movement from sources to sinks
- **Taint Analysis** - Following untrusted data propagation
- **Points-to Analysis** - Memory aliasing and pointer relationships
- **Symbolic Execution** - Path exploration with symbolic values
- **Model Checking** - Formal verification against specifications

## Dynamic Analysis Techniques
- **Fuzzing** - Automated input generation and testing
- **Dynamic Taint Tracking** - Runtime data flow monitoring
- **Memory Sanitizers** - Runtime memory error detection (AddressSanitizer, Valgrind)
- **Coverage-Guided Testing** - Execution path exploration
- **Runtime Monitoring** - Behavioral analysis during execution

## Hybrid Techniques
- **Concolic Testing** - Concrete + symbolic execution
- **SAGE/DART** - Whitebox fuzzing with constraint solving
- **Directed Symbolic Execution** - Target-specific path exploration

## Specialized Techniques
- **Information Flow Analysis** - Confidentiality and integrity tracking
- **Race Condition Detection** - Concurrent execution analysis

- **Buffer Bounds Analysis** - Array access validation
- **Cryptographic Misuse Detection** - Security API usage patterns

## Machine Learning Approaches
- **Vulnerability Prediction Models** - Statistical pattern recognition
- **Code Similarity Analysis** - Known vulnerability matching
- **Anomaly Detection** - Unusual pattern identification
- **Neural Code Analysis** - Deep learning on code representations

Each technique has specific strengths for different vulnerability types and can be combined for comprehensive analysis coverage.


Based on research effectiveness and industry adoption, here are the top two techniques from each category:

## Static Analysis Techniques

**1. Taint Analysis**
- Exceptional at finding input validation vulnerabilities (injection attacks, XSS, etc.)
- High precision in tracking untrusted data flows
- Successfully used in tools like CodeQL, Semgrep, and commercial SAST tools

**2. Code Property Graphs (CPG)**
- Combines multiple analysis types (AST + CFG + PDG) for comprehensive coverage
- Excellent for complex vulnerability patterns requiring structural + semantic analysis
- Powers advanced tools like Joern, CodeQL, and helps detect sophisticated bugs

## Dynamic Analysis Techniques

**1. Fuzzing (especially Coverage-Guided)**
- Outstanding track record for finding real-world vulnerabilities
- AFL, libFuzzer have discovered thousands of CVEs
- Particularly effective for memory corruption and parser vulnerabilities

**2. Memory Sanitizers (AddressSanitizer/Valgrind)**
- Extremely high accuracy for memory safety issues
- AddressSanitizer finds ~70% more bugs than traditional testing
- Minimal false positives, widely adopted in industry (Google, Microsoft, etc.)

## Hybrid Techniques

**1. Concolic Testing**
- Combines concrete execution with symbolic reasoning
- Excellent path coverage and constraint solving
- Tools like SAGE have found numerous Windows vulnerabilities

**2. Directed Symbolic Execution**
- Focused analysis toward specific vulnerability targets
- More scalable than pure symbolic execution
- Effective for targeted security analysis

## Machine Learning Approaches

**1. Vulnerability Prediction Models**
- Strong statistical correlation with real vulnerability locations
- Helps prioritize code review and testing efforts
- Successfully used by Microsoft, Google for risk assessment

**2. Code Similarity Analysis**
- Highly effective at finding variants of known vulnerabilities
- Fast detection of copy-paste security bugs
- Used in tools like BinDiff, Exposé for vulnerability discovery

## Key Success Factors

These techniques stand out because they:
- **High Detection Rate**: Proven track record in finding real vulnerabilities
- **Industry Adoption**: Widely used in production security tools
- **Scalability**: Work effectively on large codebases
- **Low False Positive Rate**: Practical for developers to act upon
- **Complementary Coverage**: Each excels at different vulnerability classes

The most effective approach combines multiple techniques - for example, using taint analysis for injection vulnerabilities, fuzzing for input handling bugs, and memory sanitizers for memory safety issues.


Here are the well-known and common graph query languages used in research and industry:

## Property Graph Query Languages

**1. Cypher (Neo4j)**

- Functional, traversal-based query language
- Database-agnostic (works with multiple graph databases)
- Used by Amazon Neptune, JanusGraph, TigerGraph
- Example: `g.V().has('name', 'John').out('knows').values('name')`

## RDF/Semantic Web Query Languages

**3. SPARQL**
- W3C standard for RDF triple stores
- Widely used in semantic web and knowledge graphs
- Supported by Apache Jena, Blazegraph, Stardog
- Example: `SELECT ?name WHERE { ?person foaf:name ?name }`
